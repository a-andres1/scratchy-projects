making some things in scratch and want a nice place to share them


## Dinos in Space

Dinos in space is a video game I'm creating in scratch. So far my psuedo coding makes me think I'll need at least 6 hours for it. I'm excited to have it planned out so far. I have it scheduled to work on in [Sunsama](https://www.sunsama.com/) an app I swear by. If you use Trello to track your projects, it's very easy to switch to Sunsama to make scheduling and tracking your time a bit easier. I find Sunsama's built in timers and trackers to be a bit easier for me to manage. The big thing there being I've actually been able to build a habit to use them. And just in general I like the interface a bit more than Trello. 

I think there's probably an easier way to integrate with Github, and perhaps I'll look into that with this project moving forward.
